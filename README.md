# Project
I am copying the Yodel delivery site. I am copying the Tracking Page, Send Page and will make a custom Page where the consumer can see the progress their parcel. Screenshots of the design are in the screenshots folder. 

Technologies I plan on using:
React
Typescript
MongoDB
Graphql
Bootstrap
Tailwind
Jest

The aim of this project is to show what I have learnt and that I can implement my skills quickly.

# Today
Today
1. I explored different Routing methods and settled with "react-router-dom"
2. I added Error Page
3. Added Layout
4. Left comments on inaccuracies I would like to come back to (labelled TO DO)

I would like to learn and implement advanced typescript like narrowing, type guard, type predicates, etc. I would also like to improve my use of react-typescript (.tsx)

**I am doing 12 hour shift in my current job today so not much done**

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
